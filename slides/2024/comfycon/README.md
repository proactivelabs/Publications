# Introduction to Threat Modelling

## Overview

Good quality penetration tests have two things; a deep understanding of the
target, and an idea of a threat model - formalised or otherwise. This talk
intends to introduce the concept of threat modelling; which will help develop
skills and informal models of how to approach attacking a system when very
little of systems, processes or applications are known.

This talk will endeavour to teach penetration testers (and others) to
critically think about their targets, what matters to them and what keeps them
up at night - which ultimately leads to penetration testers making these bad
things happen to their targets.

A threat model is the idea of the target system, what can go wrong, what we can
do about it, and measuring if the controls work - at least according to models
such as Shostacks’ 4 question frame.

At the point penetration testers are engaged, we mostly care about the first
two - what is our target, and what can go wrong. Ultimately, our goals are to
make these bad things happen, and find bugs before the bad guys(TM) do.

This talk is not intended to be the implementation of STRIDE, TRIKE, PASTA or
VAST. If you know what these are, this probably isn’t the talk for you.
